We decided to implement a review micro service that presents information about
the presented product directly under the product itself.

We have decided on Python as our backend language. Our first goal is to duplicate
an existing microservice in order to stay consistent with the microservice
structure. We choose the recommendation service as it was written in Python and
located conveniently below the product on the store-page where we imagine our
recommendation service.
